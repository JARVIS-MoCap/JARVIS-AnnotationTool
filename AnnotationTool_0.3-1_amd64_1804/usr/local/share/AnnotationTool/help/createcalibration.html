<h1>Create Calibration</h1>
<hr>
<p>In this section we assume that you have already successfully recorded calibration videos as described in <a href="/usr/local/share/AnnotationTool/help/recordingcalibration.html">Recording Calibration Videos</a>.</p>
<p>
<h2>Folder Structure</h2>
To use your recorded calibration videos with the calibration tool you first need to arrange them according to the following naming scheme and folder structure. Below you can see an example
layout for a 3 camera setup that useses Camera_1 as the primary camera.

<p>
Note that if you recorded the extrinsic videos for all cameras in one recording you can still use the structure as shown above by copying the video file of your primary camera to all the subfolders.
</p>
<h2>Detailed description of all the Settings</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<ul>
<li> <b>Calibration Set Name:</b> Choose a descriptive name for your calibration set. This will be the name of the folder your calibration files will be stored in.</li>
<li> <b>Calibration Set Savepath:</b> Set the path to the directory your calibration set will be saved in.</li>
<li> <b>Seperate Recordings for Intrinsics:</b> Select <b>Yes</b> if you have recorded seperate intrinsic videos for each camera.</li>
<li> <b>Calibrate Extrinsics:</b> Select <b>No</b> if you want to calibrate only the intrinsic parameters of your cameras.</li>
<li> <b>Intrinsics Folder Path:</b> Path to the directory containing all your intrinsics recordings.</li>
<li> <b>Extrinsic Folder Path:</b> Path to the directory containing all your extrinsic recordings, structured as in the example above. If you recorded
combined intrinsics and extrinsics videos you don't have to specify an intrinsics path.</li>
<li> <b>Update Camera Names Button:</b> Click this after selecting your folder paths to auto-fill the lists on the right. You can still edit them after running the auto-fill of course.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Calibration Parameters</h3>
<ul>
<li> <b>Max. Sampling Frame Rate:</b> Maximum frame rate your videos will be sampled at to extract calibration images. If this number is higher than the frame rate of your
videos your recording frame rate will be used.</li>
<li> <b>Frames for Intrinsics Calibration:</b> Number of succesfully detected checkerboards to be used for intrinsics calibration. 20 Frames is a good starting point, add more if
you want higher precision. More than 100 is not recommended.</li>
<li> <b>Frames for Extrinsics Calibration:</b> Number of succesfully detected checkerboards to be used for extrinsics calibration. 20 Frames is a good starting point, add more if
  you want higher precision. More than 100 is not recommended.</li>
<li> <b>Save Debug Images:</b> If <b>Yes</b> is selected a debug folder containing visualizations of all detected checkerboard corners is created within the calibration set directory.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Checkerboard Layout</h3>
<ul>
<li> <b>Patter Width/Height:</b> Pattern size of the checkerboard used for calibration. Compare your checkerboard to the visualization to make sure you're using the correct pattern size.</li>
<li> <b>Side Length [mm]:</b> Side length of a single square of your checkerboard in mm.</li>
</ul>
