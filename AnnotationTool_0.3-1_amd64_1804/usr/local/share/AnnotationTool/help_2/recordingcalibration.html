<h1>Recording Calibration Videos</h1>

<h2> Intrinsics Calibration </h2>
<p>The first step to get your camera calibration files is to record one video for each camera that will be used to compute it's focal length, principal point offset and distortion
parameters. See the help/images for a visualization of what the refer to.

There are a few rules you have to follow to get the best intrinsics calibration possible:
<ul>
<li> <h3>Use an asymmetric Checkerboard</h3>
  Make sure your checkerboard doesn't look the same when rotated 180 degrees.

</center></li>

<li> <h3>Move the checkerboard along all axis (especially rotation!)</h3>
  Make sure you do not only record frames where the checkerboard is parallel to the camera (as shown in the picture on the left). Not rotating it enough makes it impossible for the tool
  to estimate the focal length correctly.

</center></li>

<li> <h3>Fill as much of the field of view with the checkerboard as possible</h3>
  To take advantage of the full resolution of your camera make sure to be close enough to the camera (or use a big enough checkerboard) to cover at least 2/3
  of the cameras field of view.

</ul>

<h2> Extrinsics Calibration </h2>
<p>The second step is to choose one primary camera. This camera defines your reference frame when doing 3D reconstruction. To calibrate the extrinsic parameters you will have to record
  videos for all possible camera pairs that contain the primary camera.
